title: Being About
prolog: Our story does not have a defined beginning. We are unable to determine
  exactly when it started, where the first memory was created. We just remember
  that our story is a meeting between three ,with one common dream For a long
  period of time, we were unable to meet each other with the third one, in our
  original organic surroundings Why ? The answer is found between the words in
  the book before you

  imaginable” The mind is everything. What you think you become. –Buddha
abdul_story_preview: "I was born in Amman, Jordan on January 6th 1983. I'm the
  youngest of 2 sisters!  I went to private school with upper class kids with a
  lot of connections . Brought up in a house  that taught me that not everyone
  is equal. Most of my environment as a kid growing up in Amman, practiced hate
  sometimes towards others. "

ifat_story: I am Ifat Golan, 44 years old, born and raised in a small village in
  Israel, my parents were farmers, so I grew up between the flowers, trees and
  plantations. This was a period when we worked together with our neighbors from
  the nearby villages. borders and separations were not an issue. It broke my
  heart when the conflict escalated and we could not see our friends and
  workers  any more.  The point when it all seemed possible again was when I
  first met the Burning Man culture back in 2012 in Israel. Amazed by the fact
  people can leave their identity at the gate and enjoy and celebrate the
  freedom of life without inhibitions. I dedicated myself to building this
  culture in Israel, serving as head of Art, in strategic relations and as a
  member at the board of directors.  Another door that was opened to me at the
  same time, was to the world of Sufizm, learning the path of love,
  participating in gatherings of people from every country in the middle east,
  no barriers, no borders, no flags. I was initiated to be a Sema Zen at the
  Sufi mevlevi order, taking part in traditional ceremonies, and leading
  workshops and retreats in Israel Turkey and even Jordan.  For me, when I move
  around in the world looking from the eyes of my heart, speaking it’s language,
  the magic of WHT IF happens.
abdul_story: My grandfather was born in Hebron in 1923 and moved to Amman Jordan
  in  1948 with three kids. My father is the fourth born in Amman.My mother's
  parents also came to Jordan in 1948. I remember my grandfather as a successful
  entrepreneur in Jordan. He has been an expert  in manufacturing pvc pipes  for
  many years! He has  been recognized and appreciated  by the Jordanian
  government.  Many times and as a kid I remember how proud I was.    He passed
  away in 1991 and  left the family in Jordan with lots of resources but sadly,
  my family didn’t manage to sustain it. My father was not an entrepreneur and
  after almost 10 years living like royalty my grandfather's resources that he
  had left us - disappeared. I remember that day as if it was yesterday.  It's
  the early 2000 and my dad was diagnosed with cancer and some doctors in
  Jordan, recommended him to go to the  US and do the treatments there.So we
  moved to the US in December 2000  with the notion of what if i don’t come back
  to Amman? I was 18 years old and was really afraid of the unknown.   I was
  frustrated, sad, and felt like my life was going out of control. I lost the
  connection to my culture and in just a few months I moved away from my family
  to Texas to earn money.  It was clear to me -Ii shall never return to Jordan
  Amman.   I was working and making some money  placing floors for a living with
  an unknown company until I felt I was in a loop, I needed to do something else
  and so...i don't know where i had the courage but i quit my job and started my
  own flooring business. I am now a master of myself. It felt good. One of the
  people I knew back then- was Yehuda, who introduced me to the Goldman
  family,who invited me for a Shabbat dinner. Here I am sitting with a culture I
  have never met before around a table,breaking bread together. I was a bit
  confused, how is this possible,that I am sitting with those peopleI I was
  taught to hate?!   , How can it be that I feel these people are my tribe?  We
  talked a lot! And about everything, and after a few years an offer came by to
  go to Burning Man, i did not know this world and it seemed like something i
  wouldn't find interesting but something drew me to say yes. It was the first
  time I remember myself recognizing the WHT IF, understanding the power of
  imagination and wishes. I completely went out of my comfort zone. I met so
  many of my tribe, and for the first time in my life - I was really happy and
  complete. I fell in love with meeting people who are different from me, who
  came from different places and other cultures. In 2018 following the footsteps
  of some friends from the Middle East, I decided to break the sequence of the
  past 18 years - I shall go back to my hometown, my birthplace. My culture.  It
  was really powerful to walk back in the streets of Amman but also very
  natural.  Standing in the middle of the day, in the middle of Amman, in the
  Middle East - my mission in life is to help connect cultures. my mission is to
  help out people to practice the one cure i believe can heal our world -  WHT
  IF
