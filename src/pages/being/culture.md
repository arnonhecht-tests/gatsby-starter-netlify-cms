### WHT IF CULTURE

What is everything and nothing?\
What is really the one thing that drives us?\
Which makes us break through our boundaries?\
Dreams?\
When was the last time you came across a challenge and tried something different as a solution?

Imagination.

Yes, imagination is probably the one thing NO ONE can ever take away from you. It is yours from the second you were born to the second you pass away.

Imagination can heal the world to become a better place, it's where visions start, it's where frequencies connect.\
Imagination is love. The unconditional kind.

After being a significant and active part of the Burning Man project and co-founding Midburn (the Israeli official Burn in Israel ) we are asking you to join us, while we offer a new culture that we call WHT IF

If we have the courage to imagine, that if we allow ourselves to look beyond reason and reality, if we can go past our fears - we can give birth to the WHT IF.

The WHT IF is not just a way of thinking, nor a way of living, it's an energy each human carries.WHT IF can be implemented in ANY world of humankind. The WHT IF is probably the most ancient conception of all time, this is how fire was discovered, that's the source of Neil Armstrong’s words : “One small step for man, One giant leap for mankind.'' It's the reason Martin Luther King said “**I Have a Dream**”.**\
WHT IF** is why we are a progressing society, this is what makes us positive and optimistic. It's our only chance for hope and for connecting cultures.

### Our Vision:

A Better You is the Best Us

### Our Mission:

One act of courage lead us to

Leave all fears behind, and trust

The power of communities and cultures

To become awakened by hope.

One day later clarity was manifested

And honesty was revealed.

It was love and truth that lead us

To become active, humbled, and

Set our intentions.

We are bridging between hearts, and

Connecting opportunities by joy and creativity.

We are encouraging transformation through participation.

### Culture values :

WHT IF is based upon 7 values, it's our DNA and our community D.N.A.

**Unique / Creative -** A state of mind wherein something is unlike anything else! You are at your greatest element. Wear your best suite, your best pair of socks, which leads you to the highest peak of yourself. When you are at your most authentic being, a frequency of inspiration is present.

It is when we leave our fears behind, when we truly understand that none of us resembles anyone else. It’s time to be yourself, special, creative, inspiring. Because When you shine - we all blossom.

**Attentive -** The most prodigious gift you can offer yourself and those around you is being at your deepest sensitivity to what's around you, be present ,like a curious child (about everything?) to all that surrounds you. We are surrounded by sound, scents, sights, tastes and energy. Our deepest expressions are born from our ability to listen.

**Engage -** We are committed to a participatory ethic. Our Individual growth comes from our actions and our communal evolution rises from the power to recognize it. We engage by example, from being inspired, and never by preaching.

**Equilibrium -** All of our souls are equal, one is never above the other. We seek to find the ultimate balance between our dreams and our fulfillment. Everyone is invited to dream and everyone is invited to engage.

**Gratitude** - We encourage all human beings to be at their purest kindness. We say thank you with our eyes and hearts and gift our appreciation to whomever is in need.

We assume the positive over the negative by choosing to even see a little light.

**Sharing -** we are dedicated to an act of sharing. By that, we are empowering others and ourselves. An act of sharing does not obligate a return.

Sharing means giving something as an outright gift, to others but mostly to yourself.

**Ownership -** we are fully responsible over our thoughts, intentions & actions. Our ownership is a conscious & knowing choice, we make every day.

Most conflicts are resolved by first taking responsibility, which inspires others to do the same.

### Our roots :

**Ubuntu**

I am because we are :Regardless of the core values you decide - there is a plain and basic understanding that the interests of the group are always more important than your own, once you truly embrace it - more likely your core community will also embrace it and when a community focuses on its interests - magic happens. “I am because we are”**Ubuntu**(Zulu pronunciation: is a [Nguni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguni_languages) [Bantu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages) term meaning "humanity". It is often translated as "I am because we are," or "humanity towards others", but is often used in a more philosophical sense to mean "the belief in a universal bond of sharing that connects all humanity".

In [Southern Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa), it has come to be used as a term for a kind of [humanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism) philosophy, ethic, or ideology, also known as Ubuntuism propagated in the[Africanisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanization) (transition to majority rule) process of these countries during the 1980s and 1990s.

\
Since the transition to democracy in South Africa, with the [Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela) presidency [in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_general_election,_1994), the term has become more widely known outside of Southern Africa, notably popularised to English-language readers through the U[buntu theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_theology) of [Desmond Tutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmond_Tutu).\
Tutu was the chairman of the South African [Truth and Reconciliation Commission](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_and_Reconciliation_Commission_(South_Africa)>) (TRC), and many have argued that Ubuntu was a formative influence on the TRC.

### Black rock desert
