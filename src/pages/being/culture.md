### WHT IF Culture

**INTRO.**

What is everything and nothing?\
What is really the one thing that drives us?\
Which makes us break through our boundaries?\
Dreams?\
When was the last time you came across a challenge and tried something different as a solution?

Imagination.

Yes, imagination is probably the one thing NO ONE can ever take away from you. It is yours from the second you were born to the second you pass away.

Imagination can heal the world to become a better place, it's where visions start, it's where frequencies connect.\
Imagination is love. The unconditional kind.

After being a significant and active part of the Burning Man project and co-founding Midburn (the Israeli official Burn in Israel ) we are asking you to join us, while we offer a new culture that we call WHT IF

If we have the courage to imagine, that if we allow ourselves to look beyond reason and reality, if we can go past our fears - we can give birth to the WHT IF.

**The WHT IF is not just a way of thinking, nor a way of living, it's an energy each human carries.\
WHT IF can be implemented in ANY world of humankind. The WHT IF is probably the most ancient conception of all time, this is how fire was discovered, that's the source of Neil Armstrong’s words : “One small step for man, One giant leap for mankind.'' It's the reason Martin Luther King said“IHave a Dream”.\
WHT IFis why we are a progressing society, this is what makes us positive and optimistic. It's our only chance for hope and for connecting cultures.**
