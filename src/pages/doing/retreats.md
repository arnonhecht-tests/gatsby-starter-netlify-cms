**RETREATS**

> If you want to awaken all of humanity, awaken all of yourself - Lao Tzu

### Introduction

From the moment of birth we are nourished and groomed in cultures which programme us so much, even to the level of “how to dream” Even there, where we are supposed to be imaginative with far reaching and uninhibited visions, there too, we are fed with rules and regulations. Allowed and Forbidden.

Therefore our awareness of our plenty, is limited and restricted, so that we dream mostly in secret and continue day by day, living in a reality which distances us from our true essence. Our element.

Most of us work at jobs which don't broaden our scope, while our hidden and revealed talents are unable to be expressed.

We work around the clock and not for ourselves. Our ability to be different and authentic has been extinguished. We've declared social and cultural rules, which shut down instead of opening up.

Nature has been ruined, our attitude towards animals and ecological systems have become blinded. The main reason being, that we have become slaves to other people`s dreams, while in our core essence, we are creatures of dreams and fulfillment.



### Why Retreat

The interpretation of the word retreat is “withdraw”, meaning to withdraw temporarily for a period of time, to a neutral/noise free place, in order to undergo a significant procedure of self-redeeming, from the reality of your life in the future and in the course of time after the procedure. In retreats, as part of the WHT IF culture, we enhance new dream consciousness.

This does not mean the dreams we dream when we are asleep at night, instead these are dreams every one of us has, which has an element of self-fulfillment and a connection to ourselves.

These are the same dreams, that when we contemplate them, our whole body reacts, trembling with an inner burning, a desire, our hearts open up. As a part of our retreats, we are aspiring to connect to the new consciousness, where there are no limitations and no inhibitions and everything (yes! everything) is possible for all of us.

In our days together we will undergo experimental procedures where we will learn to recognize the WHT IF moments in our lives and our dreams. We will also learn how to recognize those dreams, which we don’t dare to express to ourselves, mostly because it seems illogical. And through the 7 Steps Ring, which we developed, we will pass through the stages, to fulfill our dreams.

We will test our capability to leave our comfort zones, bringing to the forefront our basic boldness and courage to dream, with the ability to overcome our fear and try to experience fulfillment, without the worry of failure.

This is in fact the basis of our joint journey, enhancing the same new culture, which will help to heal and flourish the world.

This will also constitute the foundation for the exclusive journey for each and every one of us, on the way to personal growth and the creating of a new reality for ourselves.

We believe that the achievements need a supportive culture and through the retreats and our events, we will create a community for all of us, which will empower and encourage us to dream and to return to fulfill our dreams, no matter what.

Luckily we live in a time where our WHT IF ability is weakening. We are here to remind ourselves of the basic need and use of our imagination. Our dreams.

History was and always will be written by the power of humans, to imagine their dreams and aspirations
