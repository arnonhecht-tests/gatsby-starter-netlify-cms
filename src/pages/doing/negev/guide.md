**Guide**

The Negev desert is the name of the vast area located in Israel, in the Middle East.

Our project has a number of meeting places among cultures around the world. Negev desert is one of them

WHT IF is involved in the development of a new culture, whose aim is to bridge and connect among different cultures, who do not generally meet.

TheNegevis a desert and semi desert region of southern Israel. The region's largest city and administrative capital is Beersheba. At it`s southern end is the Gulf of Aqaba and the resort city of Eilat. It contains several development towns, including Dimona, Arad and Mitzpe Ramon, as well as a number of small Bedouin cities, including Rahat and Tel as-Sabi and Lakiya.

The origin of the word 'Negev' is from the root denoting 'dry'. In the Bible, the wordNegevis also used for the direction 'south'; some English-language translations use the spelling "Negeb".

The Negev is a rocky desert. It is a m√©lange of brown, rocky, dusty mountains interrupted by wadis (dry riverbeds that bloom briefly after rain) and deep craters. It can be split into five different ecological regions.

Nomadic life in the Negev dates back at least 4,000 years and perhaps as much as 7,000 years.

The first urbanized settlements were established by a combination of Canaanite, Amalekite, Amorite, Nabataean and Edomite groups circa 2000 BCE .PharaonicEgypt is credited with introducing copper mining and smelting in both the Negev and the Sinai between 1400 and 1300 BCE.
