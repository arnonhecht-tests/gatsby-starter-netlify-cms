**Participate**

WHT IF is not an annual event. WHT IF is a new culture, which we are humbly offering to the world. We are a global community spread out all over the globe

We believe that leaving your comfort zone is critical for our development

We believe in strengthening social connections in which we will flourish, bringing beneficial and positive influences on ourselves and those around us.

There are numerous channels in which to integrate

Come and be part of the Change-makers Community

Imagine how fascinating it could be, meeting cultures you never knew about, with a person you never met before

We invite you to take a deep breath for a moment, leave your comfort zone and embark on a journey which starts right ‘“here”.
