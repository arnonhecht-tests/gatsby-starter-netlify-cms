### **GATHERINGS**

We are human beings, whose operational systems are based on interaction among people that is how we develop, drawing inspiration, motivating and activating, to create positive changes

In the last 2 decades, we have come to understand, that what we are most connected to, after all, are the casual human gatherings. Simple encounters, with a free open agenda, where anyone can be at their most authentic and in their element.

We believe that human beings should leave their comfort zones as much as possible, this is how we develop, what largely motivates us. This is what creates change and a positive influence on us and those surrounding us.

These gatherings can be created by anyone. We are here to encourage them, support and motivate them. They can take place anywhere you wish and can be any size you want.

During the year, we will invite you to these meetings, which we will initiate. They will take place in many geographical locations, to enable us to fulfill our vision (\*link\*)

Our meetings will always be based on participation and taking responsibility. No stage and no audience. We will create the contents for ourselves.

Our gatherings will always be based on the same new culture under discussion. They will always take place under the principles of the project (\*link\*)
