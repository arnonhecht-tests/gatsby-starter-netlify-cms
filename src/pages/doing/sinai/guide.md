**Guide**

“A BETTER YOU IS THE BEST OF US”.

One act of courage lead us to leave all fears behind, and trust the power of communities and cultures To be awakened by hope. One day later clarity was manifested and honesty was revealed. It was love and truth that led us to become active, humbled, and set our intentions. We are bridging between hearts, and connecting opportunities by joy and creativity. We are encouraging transformation through participation.

What is everything and nothing? What is really the one thing that drives us? Which makes us break through our boundaries?

Dreams? When was the last time you came across a challenge and tried something different as a solution? Imagination.

Probably the one thing NO ONE can take away from you. It is yours from the second you were born to the second you pass away. Imagination can heal the world to become a better place, it's where visions starts, it's where frequencies connect. Imagination is love. The unconditional kind.

If we have the courage to imagine, if we allow ourselves to look beyond reason and reality, if we can go past our fears - we can give birth to the WHT IF.

The WHT IF is a way of thinking, it's a way of living, and it can be implemented in ANY world of human kind. The WHT IF is probably the most ancient conception of all times. This is how fire was invented, this is why we are a progressing society, this is what makes us positive and optimistic. It's our only chance for hope and for connecting cultures.

Our set of values:

Unique / Creative-a state of mind wherein something is unlike anything else! You are at your highest element. Wear your best self suite, your best pair of sox which leads you to your highest peak of yourself. When you are at your most authentic being, a frequency of inspiration is present.

It is when we leave our fears behind, when we truly understand that none of us resembles anyone else. It’s time to be yourself, special, creative, inspiring. Because when you shine - we all blossom.

Attentive-The most prodigious gift you can offer yourself and those around you is being at your deepest sensitivity, to what's around you, be present.. Like a curious child (about everything?) to all that surrounds you. We are surrounded by sound, scents, sights, tastes and energy. Our deepest expressions are born from our ability to listen.

Engage-We are committed to a participatory ethic. Our individual growth comes from our actions and our communal evolution, rises from the power to recognize it. We engage by example, and from being inspired, and never by preaching.

Equilibrium-All of our souls are equal, one is never above the other. We seek to find the ultimate balance between our dreams and our fulfillment. Everyone is invited to dream and everyone is invited to engage.

Gratitude-We encourage all human beings to be at their purest kindness. We say thank you with our eyes and hearts and gift our appreciation to whomever is in need.

We assume the positive over the negative by choosing to even see a little light.

Sharing-we are dedicated to an act of sharing. By that we are empowering others and ourselves. An act of sharing does not contemplate a return.

Sharing means giving something as an outright gift, to others but mostly to yourself.

Ownership-we are fully responsible over our thoughts, intentions and actions. Our ownership is a conscious and knowing choice, we make every day.

Most conflicts are resolved by first taking responsibility, which inspires others to do the same.

## The desert elements- Extreme conditions

The Negev region is arid. receiving very little rain due to its location to the east of the[Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahara)(as opposed to the Mediterranean which lies to the west of Israel), and extreme temperatures due to its location 31 degrees north. However the northernmost areas of the Negev, are semi-arid. The usual rainfall total from June through October is zero. Snow and frost are rare in the northern Negev, and snow and frost are unknown in the vicinity of Eilat in the southernmost Negev.

The Negev Desert is big. Daytime temperatures routinely exceed 100°F, with low humidity. Because the landscape is so dry, you may not feel particularly warm, but like in most deserts you’ll be steadily drying up.

As most deserts, your skin will burn much faster and more severely. don't forget to apply sunscreen as needed. Have some kind of shade for your home away from home and consider sheltering during the hottest part of the day. Not like other deserts around the world When the sun drops over the horizon, temperatures do not drop and nights are nice and could be a little chilli.

It takes nearly everyone a day or so to acclimate to the desert climate. DRINK WATER!

Consuming alcohol, caffeine or other drugs increases risk of dehydration.

## Air

WHT IF location can be subject to sudden bouts of fierce, unpredictable weather. wind gusts prowl the location and can produce strong winds The desert wind can whip up to speeds exceeding 35 mph in an instant, If you’re caught in a strong wind gust :

Weight the interior corners of your tent. Rebar makes excellent stakes but the ends must be capped or bent into a candy cane shape to prevent foot or leg injuries.

Be alert for moving objects.

Most importantly - stake down your temporary home, place a heavy weight inside your tent and tie down anything that can fly.

## Water

There is no need to bring your own water! But you are more than welcome to do so. We will have water available for you.

If you do wish to bring your own water then You will need 1 gallon of water per person per day for drinking. Always carry a full water bottle when you leave your tent.

## Build your home away from home

All options are open for you.

You can bring your own tent and shelter, or, you can choose any kind of the home that we are offering. There are limited homes so we suggest that you reserve a home in advance to avoid an unpleasant situation.\
You can log into our system and select a home and a location for it.

Some homes have a private toilet and shower facilities but most homes are comfortable and basic. Remember - in this “vacation” you will hardly spend time at your home.

RV’s are always a great option, our team would love to assist you with infrastructures like electricity, gas and water.

## Stay Healthy

The first thing you should practice while planning your WHT IF experience is being responsible. getting to the desert sick is probably not such a good idea.

One of the top complaints in the desert is dehydration. don't be a smartass, trust us, as we have seen this so many times… DRINK WATER!!! And then drink some more.\
If your illness or injury is more severe than you can manage yourself, ask your tribemates for assistance.

Alternately, get yourself to one of our medical stations at the site. Look for the large medical signs. We have all emergency forces ready to take care of you but we would love them to be completely bored and so, please take care of yourself.

We also have medical patrol moving around to assist you and take care of your health.

If by any chance you need a hospital - we can support your transportation and assist. don't wait for the last minute, if you don't feel well - come to the medical space. Please make sure you have proper medical insurance.\
If you suffer from any medical condition please carry a note on yourself at all times which describes your medical condition.

# Be Hygienic

Please! We know how it feels to get to an amazing social amusement park but don't forget to keep clean. Wash your hands at every chance, sanitize your hands and always clean your cooking equipment, keep your food fresh and cooled (you can get ice in the center).\
Always Carry with you alco-gel, toilet paper, and a plastic bag for trash.

The local Division of Public and Behavioral Health strongly recommends each tribe and individuals have hand washing stations set up for regular hand-washing use.

**Consent - probably the most important chapter you all need to read:**

WHT IF is committed to making our environment safe. We are a family, and we always take care of or own.

Are you a good listener ? Let's admit it, we all need a little improvement, right?

So please take a moment and think of consent as a listening mode. When listening becomes your priority - consent will be easier to achieve.

Consent is the cornerstone of a healthy community. We encourage anyone who shares our community’s space, to look around and listen to the environment, if you recognize a situation where someone does not listen and is not truly asking for consent - to intervene and to assist the situation by being sensitive, on one hand, but uncompromising on the other. Our true community’s strengths are our solidarity and unity.

Consent occurs when one person voluntarily agrees to the proposal or desires of another. It is a term of common speech, with specific definitions as used in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships. you are responsible for getting verbal consent before engaging. It is neither ethical nor acceptable to proceed without that person’s awareness and clear consent.

If you see someone who needs assistance, step up and offer it. if you see someone being treated any way but wonderfully, step in and be an advocate. Be sensitive when you approach, but don't let the inconvenience hold you, it's a life that you might be saving.

Please remember at all times - consent is a way of living, it is not related only to physical contact, it's about respecting the freedom of others and letting them choose freely.

**Photography -** Ask before taking pictures. Remember consent to take a picture is not consent to post it on your social media app. And it’s never consent to sell the photo or use it for any commercial purpose.

**Your Well Being**

All of WHT IF spaces are not immune to the potential dangers of drug and other substances use and misuse. WHT IF and its partners in health and safety, including law enforcement, believe in the importance of harm reduction.

Drink water! Always take your own water wherever you go

Get enough rest, the desert can be harsh.

Be aware of the potential risks around you, if you recognize a danger - don't try to fix it by yourself, call one of the production crew or law enforcement personnel.

**Be aware of your belongings**

Always take responsibility for your valuables, Consider locking valuables in your car. Take pictures of your valuables and valuable documents.\
Report immediately to the main station if something is missing; Police can’t easily investigate otherwise. Get to know your neighbors, it's probably the best way to create safety around your home away from home. Work together to keep your neighborhood safe.

**Lasers & Laser Safety**

Handheld lasers are not permitted unless approved by the production crew.\
Lasers can be extremely dangerous to other participants.

**Safety: Building your home/camp**

Always have a pre-plan and have a professional take a look. Remember! It's windy out there, so keep in mind to stake down anything which might move. Check your structures and tent twice a day and make sure everything is secured and intact.\
Always Start by assembling all your team and brief them on the right safety instructions, If a new community member arrives late - please have them go through the same brief before starting working.

Have an emergency plan for all tribe members, this can save lives.\
Always have safety/extinguishing means.\
Fire is prohibited unless instructed differently and in any case, fires will have to be approved by the production crew.

**Transportation**

As far as getting to and from WHT IF locations, here are a few things to remember :

Driving under the influence is definitely prohibited.

Don’t speed. just don't. All of our locations are hidden in massive beautiful desert locations, so drive slowly, and enjoy the scenery.

We strongly recommend that you use our transportation service which will take you safely into the event.\
Riding with the WHT IF transportation demands a prepay. You won't be able to use money on the actual ride. The driver should not charge you.

**Neighbours**

With many people traveling through normally quiet rural towns, we have a significant impact on the communities surrounding the Negev Desert. Please! Drive slowly. Be kind and patient, and be respectful. We are the guests here. Be polite and friendly to all local residents and most importantly - keep it clean and don't litter or leave trash anyware.

**Sound Policy**

Sound moves so easily around the desert. Audio systems must be held to a maximum power amplification of 300 watts! Not more. We encourage you to express yourself at all times, but remember that you are sharing a space with others.\
You can generate 85 decibels at 20 feet. Speakers must be elevated off the ground surface and backed by a truck, RV, or anything large and solid enough to prevent the sound from traveling backward. If a problem with sound levels continues after sufficient requests and warnings, the source of power for such device or system will be disabled.\
If you are planning to produce sound you should reach out to our production crew to be debriefed for sound policy.

Get to know your Neighbours and their sensitivities! Most situations are resolved by communicating and listening.
