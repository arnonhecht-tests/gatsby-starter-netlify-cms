When was the last time you came across a challenge and tried something different as a solution?
Imagination.
Yes, imagination is probably the one thing NO ONE can ever take away from you. It is yours from the second you were born to the second you pass away.
Imagination can heal the world to become a better place, it's where visions start, it's where frequencies connect.
Imagination is love. The unconditional kind.
Why WHT IF ? WHT if is a new culture, After being a significant and active part of the Burning Man project and co-founding Midburn (the Israeli official Burn in Israel ) we are asking you to join us, while we offer a new culture that we call WHT IF
If we have the courage to imagine, that if we allow ourselves to look beyond reason and reality, if we can go past our fears - we can give birth to the WHT IF.
The WHT IF is not just a way of thinking, nor a way of living, it's an energy each human carries.
