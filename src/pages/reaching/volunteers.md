### Volunteer

There are many channels of participation in the WHT IF project
We consider the value of participation, as a significant value, which contributes to our transformation
From rich experience about participation value, we now know today, that the value of the experience is significantly enhanced, when we participate in the total expanse
When we participate and give, we experience a kind of empowerment. We hold the right to influence others, encourage them and through participation, we bestow a gift on ourselves first and the of course to the surroundings
