Volunteer

There are many channels of participation in the WHT IF project

We consider the value of participation, as a significant value, which contributes to our transformation

From rich experience about participation value, we now know today, that the value of the experience is significantly enhanced, when we participate in the total expanse

When we participate and give, we experience a kind of empowerment. We hold the right to influence others, encourage them and through participation, we bestow a gift on ourselves first and the of course to the surroundings

Wht is WHT IF ?

What is everything and nothing?\
What is really the one thing that drives us?\
Which makes us break through our boundaries?\
Dreams?\
When was the last time you came across a challenge and tried something different as a

solution?

Imagination.

Yes, imagination is probably the one thing NO ONE can ever take away from you. It is yours from the second you were born to the second you pass away.

Imagination can heal the world to become a better place, it's where visions start, it's where frequencies connect.\
Imagination is love. The unconditional kind.



Why WHT IF ?WHT if is a new culture, After being a significant and active part of the Burning Man project and co-founding Midburn (the Israeli official Burn in Israel ) we are asking you to join us, while we offer a new culture that we call WHT IF

If we have the courage to imagine, that if we allow ourselves to look beyond reason and reality, if we can go past our fears - we can give birth to the WHT IF.

The WHT IF is not just a way of thinking, nor a way of living, it's an energy each human carries.\
WHT IF can be implemented in ANY world of humankind. The WHT IF is probably the most ancient conception of all time, this is how fire was discovered, that's the source of Neil Armstrong’s words : “One small step for man, One giant leap for mankind.'' It's the reason Martin Luther King said“IHave a Dream”.\
WHT IFis why we are a progressing society, this is what makes us positive and optimistic. It's our only chance for hope and for connecting cultures.
