### **Global Blog**

The WHT IF community is a global community. Our community members live all over the world.

We draw inspiration from each other from our life stories, from the insights, from the successes and also from failures.

Your story is important. This is what motivates us for participation, achievement and fulfillment

Here you can share your story with all of us.

Here too, we will update you on all that's happening in our activities and from time to time we will write and update on events, retreats, cooperation that is happening right now

### **Get involved**

WHT IF is not an annual event. WHT IF is a new culture, which we are humbly offering to the world. We are a global community spread out all over the globe

We believe that leaving your comfort zone is critical for our development

We believe in strengthening social connections in which we will flourish, bringing beneficial and positive influences on ourselves and those around us.

There are numerous channels in which to integrate
